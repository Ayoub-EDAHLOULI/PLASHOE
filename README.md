# PLASHOE

## Project Overview:

For my final year project, I developed an ecommerce website named PLASHOE, aimed at providing a seamless online shopping experience for shoe enthusiasts. This comprehensive project involved the development of both frontend and backend components, followed by a strategic deployment phase. The goal was to create a fully functional, user-friendly, and scalable ecommerce platform.

## Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, Redux, SASS
Backend: Express, Prisma, MySQL

1. Problem Statement:

The retail shoe industry faces challenges in providing a seamless and engaging online shopping experience. Many existing platforms lack modern UI/UX design, efficient state management, and robust backend support, leading to user dissatisfaction and poor sales performance.

2. Solution:

PLASHOE addresses these issues by leveraging cutting-edge web technologies to create a highly responsive and user-friendly ecommerce platform. The project showcases a complete solution from frontend to backend, ensuring a smooth and engaging shopping experience for users.

3. Key Features:

Intuitive User Interface: Built with React.js, the frontend offers a dynamic and interactive user experience. Users can easily browse products, view detailed information, and manage their shopping cart.
State Management: Utilizing Redux, the application ensures consistent state management across the entire user interface, providing a seamless experience even with complex interactions.
Responsive Design: SASS is used to create a responsive design, ensuring the website is accessible and visually appealing on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Robust Backend: The backend, built with Express and Prisma, offers reliable and scalable support for managing products, user data, orders, and more. Prisma’s ORM capabilities simplify database interactions, making the system efficient and easy to maintain.

4. Benefits:

Enhanced User Experience: The modern UI/UX design and efficient state management result in a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience, increasing user satisfaction and retention.
Performance and Scalability: The backend architecture ensures fast and reliable performance, while the deployment strategy allows the application to scale seamlessly with growing traffic.
Security: Implementing JWT-based authentication and secure database connections ensures that user data is protected, fostering trust and credibility.

5. Demonstration:

Homepage: Showcases featured products, categories, and promotions with a visually appealing layout.
Product Details Page: Provides detailed information about each product, including images, descriptions, and reviews.
Shopping Cart: Allows users to add, remove, and manage products in their cart with real-time updates.
Checkout Process: A streamlined checkout process that includes order summary, shipping details, and payment options.
Admin Dashboard: An admin interface for managing products, orders, and users, demonstrating the backend’s robust capabilities.

## Conclusion:

PLASHOE is a testament to my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-fledged ecommerce platform using modern web development technologies. This project not only highlights my technical skills but also my understanding of user-centric design, scalable architecture, and secure deployment practices. I am confident that PLASHOE addresses the current challenges in the ecommerce industry and offers a comprehensive solution for online shoe retail.
